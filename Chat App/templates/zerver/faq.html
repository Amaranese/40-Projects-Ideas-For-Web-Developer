                    Guests cannot see or join streams they are not invited
                    to. Guests subscribed to more than 1 stream are billed
                    like regular users. Guests subscribed to a single stream
                    are generally free, unless you have more than 5 times as
                    many single-stream guests as paying users. More details

                    What is the difference between automatic and manual billing?
                </div>
                <p class="answer">
                    With automatic billing, you automatically purchase a Zulip license
                    for each user in your organization at the start of each billing period
                    (month or year). Deactivating a user frees up their license for reuse.
                    Additional licenses are purchased automatically as needed.

                    With manual billing, you choose and pay for a preset user limit. If
                    the limit is reached, no more users can join until licenses are manually
                    added.

                    In general, we highly recommend selecting automatic billing unless you
                    have a specific reason to do otherwise.
