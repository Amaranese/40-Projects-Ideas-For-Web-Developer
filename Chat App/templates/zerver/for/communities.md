## Zulip: Designed with communities in mind

Zulip is designed to help thoughtful people work on difficult problems
together, whether they work from a shared office or from all over the
world. Zulip offers an ideal platform for communities of all types,
including open-source projects, research collaborations, volunteer
organizations, and other groups of people who share a common pursuit.

The Zulip core developers have decades of combined experience leading
and growing open source communities, and we use Zulip to fashion the
day-to-day experience of being a part of our project. No other chat
product comes close to Zulip in facilitating contributor engagement and
inclusion, and making efficient use of everyone‚Äôs time.

## Challenges with other communication tools

Problems with the Slack/Discord/IRC model, discussed
in detail [here](/why-zulip), are even more important for open communities:


- Members of open communities may be scattered all over the world and
  in every time zone. Traditional communication tools like email
  lists, forums, and issue trackers work well in this context, because
  you can communicate effectively asynchronously. A Slack community is
  a bad experience if you‚Äôre rarely online at the same time as most
  other members, making it harder to be inclusive of all participants.
- Many members of open communities have other fulltime obligations and
  can only spend a few hours a week on the community. Because Slack is
  very hard to skim, these part-time community members cannot
  efficiently use their time participating in an active Slack. So
  either they don‚Äôt participate in the Slack, or they do, and their
  other contributions to the community‚Äôs efforts suffer.

Zulip‚Äôs topic-based threading helps us manage simultaneous discussions with clarity, ensuring the right people can pay attention to the right messages. This makes our large-group discussion far more manageable than what we‚Äôve experienced with Skype and Slack.‚Äù

- Many of us are busy people, who really wish we had more time to do
  focus work. Because active participation in Slack fundamentally
  requires constant interruptions, leaders of communities that use
  Slack end up making unpleasant choices between participating in the
  Slack community (limiting their ability to do focus work) or
  ignoring the Slack community (leaving it effectively without their
  input and potentially unmoderated).
- Writing to a busy Slack channel often means interrupting another
  existing conversation. This makes it harder for newer and shyer
  members to jump into the community. Often this disproportionately
  affects groups that are already underrepresented.
- The lack of organization in Slack message history (and its 10K
  message history limit) mean that users asking for help cannot
  effectively do self-service support. This results in the community
  answering a lot of duplicate questions.

The overall effect is that Slack is a poor communication tool for
communities that want to have an inclusive, global, community and that
many busy individuals can happily participate in.

## Solution: Zulip‚Äôs topic-based threading

Zulip‚Äôs topic-based threading model solves the problems described above:

- Community members in any time zone can send messages and expect to
  get a reply and have an effective (potentially asynchronous)
  conversation with the rest of the community.
- Zulip‚Äôs topic-based threading helps include part-time community
  members in two major ways. First, they can easily browse what
  conversations happened while they were away from the community, and
  prioritize which conversations to read now, skip, or read later
  (e.g. on the weekend). Second, Zulip makes it easy for them to have
  public conversations with participation from other community members
  (potentially split over hours, days, or weeks as needed), allowing
  them to fully participate in the work of the community.
- Community leaders can effectively participate in a Zulip community
  without being continuously online. Using Zulip‚Äôs [keyboard
  shortcuts](/help/keyboard-shortcuts), it‚Äôs
  extremely efficient to inspect every potentially relevant thread and
  reply wherever one‚Äôs feedback is useful, and replying hours after a
  question was asked is still a good experience for community
  members. As a result, leaders can do multi-hour sessions of focus
  work while still being available to their community.
- Topics make it easier to provide a safe, welcoming, online
  community. Asking a question never has to feel like an interruption
  of an ongoing conversation or like one's sticking one's neck out.

## Try Zulip today!

You can see Zulip in action in our own
[Zulip development community](https://zulip.com/development-community/), which sends
thousands of messages a week. We often get feedback from contributors
around the world that they love how responsive Zulip‚Äôs project leaders
are in public Zulip conversations. We are able to achieve this despite
the project leaders collectively spending only a few hours a day
managing the community and spending most of their time integrating
improvements into Zulip.

Many communities that migrated from
[Slack](/help/import-from-slack),
[Mattermost](/help/import-from-mattermost),
[Gitter](/help/import-from-gitter), or
[Rocket.Chat](/help/import-from-rocketchat) to Zulip tell us
that Zulip helped them manage and grow an inclusive, healthy
community. We hope Zulip can help your community succeed too!
