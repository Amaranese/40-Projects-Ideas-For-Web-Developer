# Dark theme

Zulip provides both a light theme and a dark theme, which is great
for working in a dark space.

## Manage color theme

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|display-settings}

2. Under **Theme**, configure **Color scheme**.

{end_tabs}

The default is **Sync with computer**, which detects which theme to use based
on the color scheme used by your operating system.

You can also specify **Dark theme** or **Light theme** if you'd like
Zulip to use the same color scheme regardless of your operating system
configuration.
