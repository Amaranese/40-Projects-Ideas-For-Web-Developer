# Open the compose box

The Zulip compose box starts off closed by default, leaving more vertical
space for the message feed. There are a number of ways to open the compose box.

## Using the mouse

* Click on any message.

* Click on **Message...**, **New topic**, or **New private message** at the
  bottom of the screen.

## Using the keyboard

All replies are to the message in the **blue box**.

* **Reply**: `r` or `Enter`

* **New topic**: `c`

* **New private message**: `x`

You can move the blue box around using the **arrow keys**, `j`, or `k`. You
can close the compose box using `Esc`, or up/down arrow if the box is empty.
