# Edit your profile

By default, your profile includes your name, email, the date you joined, and
when you were last active.

Organization administrators can also
[add custom profile fields](/help/add-custom-profile-fields). Custom profile
fields are always optional, and will not appear in your profile unless you
fill them out.
