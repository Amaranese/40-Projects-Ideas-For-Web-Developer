# Demo organizations

!!! warn ""

    **Note:** The ability to create demo organizations is an upcoming
    feature. It is not available yet.

If you would like to try out Zulip without having to make any
decisions (like how to name your organization or whether to import
data from an existing chat tool), you can create a Zulip demo
organization.

Demo organizations differ from a regular Zulip organization in a few
ways:

* A demo organization will be automatically deleted 30 days after
  creation. You can convert a demo organization into a regular
  organization if you'd prefer to keep its history.
* You do not need to choose a URL when creating a demo organization;
  one will be generated automatically for you.
* A demo organization cannot be upgraded to Zulip Cloud Standard
  without first converting to a regular organization.

Other than those limitations, they work exactly like a normal Zulip
organization; you can invite additional users, connect the mobile
apps, etc.
