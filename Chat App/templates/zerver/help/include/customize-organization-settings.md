want it to be.

{relative|gear|manage-organization}

1. Click on "Organization settings" and "Organization permissions"
   tabs, and any others that are of interest.

{end_tabs}

A few settings to highlight:

* Decide [who can invite new users][who-can-invite], or whether
  [anyone can join without an invitation][who-can-join].

* [Set visibility for users' email addresses][email-address-visibility].

* If your organization uses a programming language, set the [default
  language for code blocks][default-code-block-language]. Also
  consider setting up [code playgrounds][code-playgrounds].

* If your organization uses code repositories, [set up
  linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) to make it easy to link to
  issues (e.g. just by typing #1234 for issue 1234).

* [Add custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji), including your organization's logo.

For many other settings, e.g. [message and topic editing
permissions][topic-editing-permissions], you can experience how Zulip
works for your organization before deciding what settings are best for
you.
