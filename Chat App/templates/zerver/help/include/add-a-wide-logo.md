You can customize the logo users see in the upper left corner
of the Zulip app. For best results make sure your logo has a
transparent background, and trim any bordering whitespace. To upload a logo:

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-profile}

1. Under **Organization logo**, upload a new logo.

{end_tabs}

Make sure to test the logo in both light theme and [dark theme](/help/dark-theme).
