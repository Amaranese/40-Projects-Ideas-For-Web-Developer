* Zulip is [100% open-source software][zulip-github], with no "open core" catch.
  When you self-host Zulip, you get the same software as [Zulip Cloud
  Standard](/plans/) customers.

* Retain full control over your data and simplify compliance by self-hosting
  Zulip behind your firewall.

* We work hard to make it easy to [install][install-zulip], [back
  up][back-up-zulip], and [maintain][maintain-zulip] a self-hosted
  Zulip server. Self host Zulip directly on Ubuntu or Debian Linux, in
  <a href="https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip">Docker</a>, or with
  prebuilt images for <a
  href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/zulip">Digital
  Ocean</a> and <a
  href="https://render.com/docs/deploy-zulip">Render</a>.

* Customize Zulip for all your needs. It's easy to develop and maintain [custom
  integrations](/api/incoming-webhooks-overview) and [features][modify-zulip].
