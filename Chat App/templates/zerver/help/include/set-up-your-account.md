    If this is your first time using Zulip, we recommend starting with the web
    or desktop experience to set up your account and get oriented.

- Get the [mobile and desktop apps](/apps). Zulip also works great in a browser.
- [Add a profile picture](/help/change-your-profile-picture) and
  [edit your profile information](https://zulip.com/help/edit-your-profile) to tell others
  about yourself.
- [Review your display settings](/help/review-your-settings#review-your-display-settings).
  You can [switch between light and dark theme](/help/dark-theme),
  [pick your favorite emoji theme](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#change-your-emoji-set),
  [change your language](/help/change-your-language), and make other tweaks to your Zulip experience.
- [Browse and subscribe to streams](/help/browse-and-subscribe-to-streams).
- Decide whether you [want `Enter` to send your message](/help/enable-enter-to-send)
  or add a new line.
- [Configure your notifications](/#settings/notifications) to work the way
  you do. If you're joining a low traffic organization and aren't using the
  desktop app, consider sending all messages to email.
