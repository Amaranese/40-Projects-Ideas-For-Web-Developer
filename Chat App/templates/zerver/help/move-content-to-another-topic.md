# Move content to another topic

Zulip makes it possible to move messages between topics. This is
useful for keeping messages organized when there is a digression, or
the discussion shifts from the original topic. You can also [rename a
topic](/help/rename-a-topic).

When messages are moved, Zulip's [permanent links to messages in
context](/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#get-a-link-to-a-specific-message)
will automatically redirect to the new location of the message. [Muted
topics](/help/mute-a-topic) are automatically migrated when an entire
topic is moved.

Organizations can [configure](/help/configure-who-can-edit-topics) which
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions) have permission to modify topics. See the
[guide to message and topic editing](/help/configure-message-editing-and-deletion)
for the details on when topic editing is allowed.
