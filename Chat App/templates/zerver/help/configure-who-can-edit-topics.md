# Restrict topic editing

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, anyone can edit any message topic. This is useful because it allows
the community to keep conversations organized, even if some members are still
learning how to use topics effectively. However, you can restrict the ability to
edit the topic of any message to specific [roles](/help/roles-and-permissions).

Note that users may still be able to edit the topic of messages with
**(no topic)**; see the full article on [message and topic
editing](/help/configure-message-editing-and-deletion) for details.

Also, only administrators and moderators can edit the topics of
messages that were sent more than 3 days ago, regardless of the value
of this setting.

### Change who can edit topics

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}
