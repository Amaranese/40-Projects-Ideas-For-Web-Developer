# Error handling

Zulip's API will always return a JSON format response.
The HTTP status code indicates whether the request was successful
(200 = success, 40x = user error, 50x = server error).  Every response
will contain at least two keys: `msg` (a human-readable error message)
and `result`, which will be either `error` or `success` (this is
redundant with the HTTP status code, but is convenient when printing
responses while debugging).

For some common errors, Zulip provides a `code` attribute.  Where
present, clients should check `code`, rather than `msg`, when looking
for specific error conditions, since the `msg` strings are
internationalized (e.g. the server will send the error message
translated into French if the user has a French locale).

Each endpoint documents its own unique errors; below, we document
errors common to many endpoints:

To help clients avoid exceeding rate limits, Zulip sets the following
HTTP headers in all API responses:

* `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of additional requests of this
  type that the client can send before exceeding its limit.
* `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The limit that would be applicable to a client
  that had not made any recent requests of this type. This is useful
  for designing a client's burst behavior so as to avoid ever reaching
  a rate limit.
* `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time at which the client will no longer
  have any rate limits applied to it (and thus could do a burst of
  `X-RateLimit-Limit` requests).

Zulip's rate limiting rules are configurable, and can vary by server
and over time. The default configuration currently limits:

* Every user is limited to 200 total API requests per minute.
* Separate, much lower limits for authentication/login attempts.

When the Zulip server has configured multiple rate limits that apply
to a given request, the values returned will be for the strictest
limit.
