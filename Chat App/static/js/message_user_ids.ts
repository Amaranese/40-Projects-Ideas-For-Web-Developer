    We keep a set of user_ids for all people

    been on PMs sent by the user.

    We will use this in search to prevent really
    large result sets for realms that have lots
    of users who haven't sent messages recently.

    We'll likely eventually want to replace this with
    accessing some combination of data from recent_senders
    and pm_conversations for better accuracy.
