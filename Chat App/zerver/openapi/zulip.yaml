      summary: Fetch an API key (production)
      tags: ["authentication"]
      description: |
        This API endpoint is used by clients such as the Zulip mobile and
        terminal apps to implement password-based authentication. Given the
        user's Zulip login credentials, it returns a Zulip API key that the client
        can use to make requests as the user.

        This endpoint is only useful for Zulip servers/organizations with
        EmailAuthBackend or LDAPAuthBackend enabled.

        The Zulip mobile apps also support SSO/social authentication (GitHub
        auth, Google auth, SAML, etc.) that does not use this endpoint. Instead,
        the mobile apps reuse the web login flow passing the `mobile_flow_otp` in
        a webview, and the credentials are returned to the app (encrypted) via a redirect
        to a `zulip://` URL.

        !!! warn ""

            **Note:** If you signed up using passwordless authentication and
            never had a password, you can [reset your password](/help/change-your-password).

            See the [API keys](/api/api-keys) documentation for
            more details on how to download API key manually.

      tags: ["authentication"]
      description: |
        For easy testing of mobile apps and other clients and against Zulip
        development servers, we support fetching a Zulip API key for any user
        on the development server without authentication (so that they can
        implement analogues of the one-click login process available for Zulip
        development servers on the web).

        **Note:** This endpoint is only available on Zulip development
        servers; for obvious security reasons it will always return an error
        in a Zulip production server.

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/events`

        This endpoint allows you to receive new events from
        [a registered event queue](/api/register-queue).

        Long-lived clients should use the
        `event_queue_longpoll_timeout_seconds` property returned by
        `POST /register` as the client-side HTTP request timeout for
        calls to this endpoint. It is guaranteed to be higher than
        heartbeat frequency and should be respected by clients to
        avoid breaking when heartbeat frequency increases.

        **Note**: The parameters documented above are optional in the sense that
        even if you haven't registered a queue by explicitly requesting the
        `{{ api_url}}/v1/register` endpoint, you could pass the parameters for
        [the `{{ api_url}}/v1/register` endpoint](/api/register-queue) to this
        endpoint and a queue would be registered in the absence of a `queue_id`.

                                    be used when displaying the stream description in a UI.

                                    One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when
                                    displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
                                    work correctly. And any client-side security logic for
                                    user-generated message content should be applied when displaying
                                    this HTML as though it were the body of a Zulip message.

                                    Currently always true for public streams (i.e. invite_only=False implies
                                    history_public_to_subscribers=True), but clients should not make that
                                    assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

                                    is present for all `update_message` events. Previously, this
                                    field was omitted for [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews]
                                    updates.

                                    Whether the event only updates the rendered content of the message.

                                    This field should be used by clients to determine if the event
                                    only provides a rendering update to the message content,
                                    such as for an [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews].
                                    When `True`, the event does not reflect a user-generated edit
                                    and does not modify the message history.

                                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 114). Clients can
                                    correctly identify these rendering update event with earlier
                                    Zulip versions by checking whether the `user_id` field was omitted.
                                message_id:
                                  type: integer

                                    The ID of the message which was edited or updated.

                                    This field should be used to apply content edits to the client's
                                    cached message history, or to apply rendered content updates.

                                    If the stream or topic was changed, the set of moved messages is
                                    encoded in the separate `message_ids` field, which is guaranteed
                                    to include `message_id`.

                                    The list of IDs of messages to which any stream or topic changes
                                    encoded in this event should be applied.

                                    These messages are guaranteed to have all been previously sent
                                    to stream `stream_id` with topic `orig_subject`, and have been
                                    moved to `new_stream_id` with topic `subject` (if those fields
                                    are present in the event).

                                    Clients processing these events should update all cached message
                                    history associated with the moved messages (including adjusting
                                    `unread_msgs` data structures, where the client may not have the
                                    message itself in its history) to reflect the new stream and
                                    topic.

                                    Content changes should be applied only to the single message

                                    is present for all edits to a stream message. Previously, it
                                    was not present when only the content of the stream message was
                                    edited.

                                    Only present if message(s) were moved to a different stream.

                                    The post-edit stream for all of the messages with IDs in
                                    `message_ids`.

                                    Only present if this event moved messages to a different
                                    topic and/or stream.

                                    The choice the editing user made about which messages should be
                                    affected by a stream/topic edit:

                                    - `change_one` => Just change the one indicated in `message_id`.
                                    - `change_later` => Change messages in the same topic that had
                                      been sent after this one.
                                    - `change_all`=> Change all messages in that topic.

                                    This parameter should be used to decide whether to change
                                    navigation and compose box state in response to the edit. For
                                    example, if the user was previously in topic narrow, and the
                                    topic was edited with `change_later` or `change_all`, the Zulip
                                    web app will automatically navigate to the new topic narrow.
                                    Similarly, a message being composed to the old topic should
                                    have its recipient changed to the new topic.

                                    This navigation makes it much more convenient to move content
                                    between topics without disruption or messages continuing
                                    to be sent to the pre-edit topic by accident.

                                    Previously, this was called `subgroup_ids`, but
                                    clients can ignore older events as this feature level
                                    predates subgroups being fully implemented.

                                Event sent to all users in a Zulip organization when the
                                set of configured [linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier)
                                for the organization has changed.

                                Processing this event is important to doing Markdown local echo
                                correctly.

                                **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 54), replacing the
                                previous `realm_filters` event type, which is still sent for
                                backwards compatibility reasons.

                                Clients should migrate to requesting and processing the
                                `realm_linkifiers` event type when possible, since we plan to remove
                                the legacy `realm_filters` logic entirely in a future release.

                                the [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict) event format when additional realm
                                settings are added whose values are coupled to each other
                                in some way. The specific values supported by this event

                                documentation.

                                A correct client implementation should convert these
                                events into the corresponding [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict)
                                event and then process that.

                                Event sent to all users in a Zulip organization when the
                                organization (realm) is deactivated. Its main purpose is to
                                flush active longpolling connections so clients can immediately
                                show the organization as deactivated.

                                Clients cannot rely on receiving this event, because they will
                                no longer be able to authenticate to the Zulip API due to the
                                deactivation, and thus can miss it if they did not have an active
                                longpolling connection at the moment of deactivation.

                                Correct handling of realm deactivations requires that clients
                                parse authentication errors from GET /events; if that is done
                                correctly, the client can ignore this event type and rely on its
                                handling of the `GET /events` request it will do immediately
                                after processing this batch of events.

                                Specifically, this event is sent whenever the Tornado process
                                for the user is restarted; in particular, this will always happen
                                when the Zulip server is upgraded.

                                Clients can use this event to know when they should get a new
                                event queue after a server upgrade. Clients doing so must implement
                                a random delay strategy to spread such restarts over 10 minutes or
                                more to avoid creating a synchronized thundering herd effect.

                                    changed, or when they know the specific feature level change
                                    is not relevant to the client (E.g. it just adds a new endpoint

                      This error occurs if the target event queue has been garbage collected.
                      A compliant client will handle this error by re-initializing itself
                      (e.g. a Zulip web app browser window will reload in this case).

                      See [the /register endpoint docs](/api/register-queue) for details on how to
                      handle these correctly.

                      The following is the error response in such case:

                      step, then none of the drafts will be created and we would not get this
                      status code. The typical JSON response in such a case is:

        Fetch message history from a Zulip server.

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/messages`

        This `GET /api/v1/messages` endpoint is the primary way to fetch
        message history from a Zulip server. It is useful both for Zulip
        clients (e.g. the web, desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) as well
        as bots, API clients, backup scripts, etc.

        By specifying a [narrow filter](/api/construct-narrow), you can use
        this endpoint to fetch the messages matching any search query that is
        supported by Zulip's powerful full-text search backend.

        When a narrow is not specified, it can be used to fetch a user's
        message history. (We recommend paginating to 1000 messages at a time.)

        In either case, you specify an `anchor` message (or ask the server to
        calculate the first unread message for you and use that as the
        anchor), as well as a number of messages before and after the anchor
        message. The server returns those messages, sorted by message ID, as
        well as some metadata that makes it easy for a client to determine
        whether there are more messages matching the query that were not
        returned due to the `num_before` and `num_after` limits.

        We recommend using `num_before <= 1000` and `num_after <= 1000` to
        avoid generating very large HTTP responses. A maximum of 5000 messages
        can be obtained per request; attempting to exceed this will result in an
        error.

            Integer message ID to anchor fetching of new messages. Supports special
            string values for when the client wants the server to compute the anchor
            to use:

            - `newest`: The most recent message.
            - `oldest`: The oldest message.
            - `first_unread`: The oldest unread message matching the
              query, if any; otherwise, the most recent message.

            The special values of `'newest'` and `'oldest'` are also supported
            for anchoring the query at the most recent or oldest messages.

            **Changes**: String values are new in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). The
            `first_unread` functionality was supported in Zulip 2.1.x
            and older by not sending anchor and using use_first_unread_anchor.

            In Zulip 2.1.x and older, `oldest` can be emulated with
            `anchor=0`, and `newest` with `anchor=10000000000000000`
            (that specific large value works around a bug in Zulip
            2.1.x and older in the `found_newest` return value).

            For clients supporting

            the [event queue](/api/register-queue)
            ID for the client. If passed, `local_id` is required. If the message is
            successfully sent, the server will include `local_id` in the `message` event
            that the client with this `queue_id` will receive notifying it of the new message
            via [`GET /events`](/api/get-events). This lets the client know unambiguously
            that it should replace the locally echoed message, rather than adding this new
            message (which would be correct if the user had sent the new message from another
            device).

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/messages/matches_narrow`

        For many common narrows (E.g. a topic), clients can write an
        efficient client-side check to determine whether a
        newly arrived message belongs in the view.

        This endpoint is designed to allow clients to handle more complex narrows
        for which the client does not (or in the case of full-text search,
        cannot) implement this check.

        The format of the `match_subject` and `match_content` objects is designed to match
        those of `GET /messages`, so that a client can splice these fields into a
        `message` object received from `GET /events` and end up with an extended message
        object identical to how a `GET /messages` for the current narrow would have
        returned the message.

        Additionally, a `raw_content` field is included. This field is
        useful for clients that primarily work with HTML-rendered
        messages but might need to occasionally fetch the message's
        raw Markdown (e.g. for [view
        source](/help/view-the-markdown-source-of-a-message) or
        prefilling a message edit textarea).

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 120), this
        endpoint only returned the `raw_content` field.

        `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/user_uploads`

        Initially, only you will be able to access the link. To share the
        uploaded file, you'll need to [send a message][send-message]
        containing the resulting link. Users who can already access the link
        can reshare it with other users by sending additional Zulip messages
        containing the link.

        ## Maximum file size

        The maximum file size for uploads can be configured by the
        administrator of the Zulip server by setting `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE`
        in the [server's settings][1]. `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE` defaults
        to 25MB.

        Get the presence status for a specific user.

        This endpoint is most useful for embedding data about a user's
        presence status in other sites (E.g. an employee directory). Full
        Zulip clients like mobile/desktop apps will want to use the main
        presence endpoint, which returns data for all active users in the
        organization, instead.

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/users/{user_id_or_email}/presence`

        See
        [Zulip's developer documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/presence.html)

        Change your [status](/help/status-and-availability).

        `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/users/me/status`

        A request to this endpoint will only change the parameters passed.
        For example, passing just `status_text` requests a change in the status
        text, but will leave the status emoji unchanged.

        Clients that wish to set the user's status to a specific value should
        pass all supported parameters.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86), added support for
        `emoji_name`, `emoji_code`, and `reaction_type` parameters.
      parameters:
        - name: status_text

            The text content of the status message. Sending the empty string
            will clear the user's status.

            **Note**: The limit on the size of the message is 60 characters.
          example: on vacation
          required: false

            A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`
            has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

            Must be one of the following values:

            - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
              dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
              that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

            - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
              the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

            - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
              In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
              "zulip").

        This endpoint [mutes a user](/help/mute-a-user). Messages sent by users
        you've muted will be automatically marked as read and hidden.

        `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/users/me/muted_users/{muted_user_id}`

        Muted users should be implemented by clients as follows:

        - The server will immediately mark all messages sent by the muted
          user as read. This will automatically clear any existing mobile
          push notifications related to the muted user.
        - The server will mark any new messages sent by the muted user as read
          for your account, which prevents all email and mobile push notifications.
        - Clients should exclude muted users from presence lists or other UI
          for viewing or composing 1:1 private messages. 1:1 private messages sent by
          muted users should be hidden everywhere in the Zulip UI.
        - Stream messages and group private messages sent by the muted
          user should avoid displaying the content and name/avatar,
          but should display that N messages by a muted user were
          hidden (so that it is possible to interpret the messages by
          other users who are talking with the muted user).
        - Group private message conversations including the muted user
          should display muted users as "Muted user", rather than
          showing their name, in lists of such conversations, along with using
          a blank grey avatar where avatars are displayed.
        - Administrative/settings UI elements for showing "All users that exist
          on this stream or realm", e.g. for organization
          administration or showing stream subscribers, should display
          the user's name as normal.

        `PATCH {{ api_url }}/v1/realm/user_settings_defaults`

        This feature can be invaluable for customizing Zulip's default
        settings for notifications or UI to be appropriate for how the
        organization is using Zulip. (Note that this only supports
        personal preference settings, like when to send push
        notifications or what emoji set to use, not profile or
        identity settings that naturally should be different for each user).

        Note that this endpoint cannot, at present, be used to modify
        settings for existing users in any way.

            displays names when <=3 total reactions are present with this setting enabled.

      summary: Register an event queue
      tags: ["real_time_events"]
      description: |
        `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/register`

        This powerful endpoint can be used to register a Zulip "event queue"
        (subscribed to certain types of "events", or updates to the messages
        and other Zulip data the current user has access to), as well as to
        fetch the current state of that data.

        (`register` also powers the `call_on_each_event` Python API, and is
        intended primarily for complex applications for which the more convenient
        `call_on_each_event` API is insufficient).

        This endpoint returns a `queue_id` and a `last_event_id`; these can be
        used in subsequent calls to the
        ["events" endpoint](/api/get-events) to request events from
        the Zulip server using long-polling.

        The server will queue events for up to 10 minutes of inactivity.
        After 10 minutes, your event queue will be garbage-collected. The
        server will send `heartbeat` events every minute, which makes it easy
        to implement a robust client that does not miss events unless the
        client loses network connectivity with the Zulip server for 10 minutes
        or longer.

        Once the server garbage-collects your event queue, the server will
        [return an error](/api/get-events#bad_event_queue_id-errors)
        with a code of `BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID` if you try to fetch events from
        the event queue. Your software will need to handle that error
        condition by re-initializing itself (e.g. this is what triggers your
        browser reloading the Zulip web app when your laptop comes back online
        after being offline for more than 10 minutes).

        When prototyping with this API, we recommend first calling `register`
        with no `event_types` parameter to see all the available data from all
        supported event types. Before using your client in production, you
        should set appropriate `event_types` and `fetch_event_types` filters
        so that your client only requests the data it needs. A few minutes
        doing this often saves 90% of the total bandwidth and other resources
        consumed by a client using this API.

        See the
        [events system developer documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/events-system.html)
        if you need deeper details about how the Zulip event queue system
        works, avoids clients needing to worry about large classes of
        potentially messy races, etc.

            Dictionary containing details on features the client supports that are
            relevant to the format of responses sent by the server.

            - `notification_settings_null`: Boolean for whether the
              client can handle the current API with null values for
              stream-level notification settings (which means the stream
              is not customized and should inherit the user's global
              notification settings for stream messages).
              <br />
              New in Zulip 2.1.0; in earlier Zulip releases, stream-level
              notification settings were simple booleans.

            - `bulk_message_deletion`: Boolean for whether the client's
              handler for the `delete_message` event type has been
              updated to process the new bulk format (with a
              `message_ids`, rather than a singleton `message_id`).
              Otherwise, the server will send `delete_message` events
              in a loop.
              <br />
              New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 13). This
              capability is for backwards-compatibility; it will be
              required in a future server release.

            - `user_avatar_url_field_optional`: Boolean for whether the
              client required avatar URLs for all users, or supports
              using `GET /avatar/{user_id}` to access user avatars. If the
              client has this capability, the server may skip sending a
              `avatar_url` field in the `realm_user` at its sole discretion
              to optimize network performance. This is an important optimization
              in organizations with 10,000s of users.
              <br />
              New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18).

            - `stream_typing_notifications`: Boolean for whether the client
              supports stream typing notifications.
              <br />
              New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). This capability is
              for backwards-compatibility; it will be required in a
              future server release.

            - `user_settings_object`: Boolean for whether the client supports the modern
              `user_settings` event type. If False, the server will additionally send the
              legacy `update_display_settings` and `update_global_notifications` event
              types for backwards-compatibility with clients that predate this API migration.
              <br />
              <br />
              Because the feature level 89 API changes were merged together, clients can
              safely make a request with this client capability and requesting all of the
              `user_settings`, `update_display_settings`, and
              `update_global_notifications` event types, and get exactly one copy of
              settings data on any server version. (And then use the `zulip_feature_level`
              in the `/register` response or the presence/absence of a `user_settings` key
              to determine where to look).
              <br />
              New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89). This capability is for
              backwards-compatibility; it will be removed in a future server release.

                              Whether to display the names of reacting users on a message.

                              When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting
                              users, rather than a count, for messages with few total
                              reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on the space
                              available for displaying reactions; the official web
                              application displays names when <=3 total reactions are
                              present with this setting enabled.

                          GIPHY's client-side SDKs needs this API key to use the GIPHY API.
                          GIPHY API keys are not secret (their main purpose appears to be
                          allowing GIPHY to block a problematic app). Please don't use our API
                          key for an app unrelated to Zulip.

                              Whether to display the names of reacting users on a message.

                              When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting
                              users, rather than a count, for messages with few total
                              reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on the space
                              available for displaying reactions; the official web
                              application displays names when <=3 total reactions are
                              present with this setting enabled.

        Please note that not all of these attributes are guaranteed to appear in a
        response, for two reasons:

        * This endpoint has evolved over time, so responses from older Zulip servers
          might be missing some keys (in which case a client should assume the
          appropriate default).
        * If a `/server_settings` request is made to the root domain of a
          multi-subdomain server, like the root domain of zulip.com, the settings
          that are realm-specific are not known and thus not provided.

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/server_settings`

        **Note:** this endpoint does not require any authentication at all, and you can use it to check:

        - If this is a Zulip server, and if so, what version of Zulip it's running.
        - What a Zulip client (e.g. a mobile app or
          [zulip-terminal](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal/)) needs to
          know in order to display a login prompt for the server (e.g. what
          authentication methods are available).

                      A typical successful JSON response for a single-organization server may look like:

                          a value of N means the server supports all API features introduced
                          before feature level N. This is designed to provide a simple way
                          for client apps to decide whether the server supports a given
                          feature or API change. See the [changelog](/api/changelog) for

        This endpoint is used to edit the current user's settings.

        `PATCH {{ api_url }}/v1/settings`

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this
        endpoint only supported the `full_name`, `email`,
        `old_password`, and `new_password` parameters. Notification
        settings were managed by `PATCH /settings/notifications`, and
        all other settings by `PATCH /settings/display`.

        The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not
        change how request parameters are encoded. However, it did change
        the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request
        (see feature level 78 change below).

        The `/settings/display` and `/settings/notifications`
        endpoints are now deprecated aliases for this endpoint for
        backwards-compatibility, and will be removed once clients have
        migrated to use this endpoint.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 78),
        the `/settings` endpoint indicated which parameters it had
        processed by including in the response object `"key": value`
        entries for values successfully changed by the request. That
        was replaced by the more ergonomic
        `ignored_parameters_unsupported` response parameter.

        The `/settings/notifications` and `/settings/display` endpoints
        also had this behavior before they became aliases of `/settings`
        in Zulip 5.0 (see feature level 80 change above).

        Before these changes, request parameters that were not supported
        (or were unchanged) were silently ignored.

        `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/typing`

        Clients implementing Zulip's typing notifications protocol should work as follows:

        - Send a request to this endpoint with `op = "start"` when a user starts typing a message,
          and also every `TYPING_STARTED_WAIT_PERIOD = 10` seconds that the user continues to
          actively type or otherwise interact with the compose UI (e.g. interacting with the
          compose box emoji picker).
        - Send a request to this endpoint with `op = "stop"` when a user pauses using the
          compose UI for at least `TYPING_STOPPED_WAIT_PERIOD = 5` seconds or cancels
          the compose action (if it had previously sent a "start" operation for that
          compose action).
        - Start displaying "Sender is typing" for a given conversation when the client
          receives an `op = "start"` event from the [`GET /events`](/api/get-events#typing-start)
          endpoint.
        - Continue displaying "Sender is typing" until they receive an `op = "stop"` event
          from the [`GET /events`](/api/get-events#typing-stop) endpoint or
          `TYPING_STARTED_EXPIRY_PERIOD = 15` seconds have passed without a new `op = "start"`
          event for that conversation.
        - Support for displaying stream typing notifications was new in Zulip 4.0
          (feature level 58). Clients should indicate they support processing stream typing
          events via the `stream_typing_notifications` value in the `client_capabilities`
          parameter to [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue#parameter-client_capabilities)
          endpoint.

        This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications implementation
        to be stateless while being resilient; network failures cannot result in a user being
        incorrectly displayed as perpetually typing.

        See
        [the typing notification docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/typing-indicators.html)
        for additional design details on Zulip's typing notifications protocol.

            is new in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). Previously, typing

          nullable: true
          description: |
            Number of days that messages sent to this stream will be stored
            before being automatically deleted by the [message retention
            policy](/help/message-retention-policy). There are two special values:

            - `null`, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            - `-1` encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).
        history_public_to_subscribers:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public streams (i.e. invite_only=False implies
            history_public_to_subscribers=True), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.
        first_message_id:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The id of the first message in the stream.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "more topics" widget that would suggest the stream
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Null is used for streams with no message history.
        is_announcement_only:
          type: boolean
          deprecated: true
          description: |
            Whether the given stream is announcement only or not.

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1), use
            `stream_post_policy` instead.

          description: |
            Whether the user has muted the stream. Muted streams do
            not count towards your total unread count and do not show up in
            `All messages` view (previously known as `Home` view).

            **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 2.1, this feature was
            represented by the more confusingly named `in_home_view` (with the
            opposite value, `in_home_view=!is_muted`).
        in_home_view:
          type: boolean
          deprecated: true
          description: |
            Legacy property for if the given stream is muted, with inverted meeting.

            **Deprecated**; clients should use is_muted where available.
        is_announcement_only:
          type: boolean
          deprecated: true
          description: |
            Whether only organization administrators can post to the stream.

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1), use
            `stream_post_policy` instead.
        is_web_public:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the stream has been configured to allow unauthenticated
            access to its message history from the web.

          description: |
            The user's role within the stream (distinct from the user's
            [organization-level role](/help/roles-and-permissions)).
            Valid values are:

            - 20 => Stream administrator.
            - 50 => Subscriber.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 31).
        color:

            The user's personal color for the stream.
        stream_post_policy:

            [Policy][permission-level] for which users can post messages to the stream.

            - 1 => Any user can post.
            - 2 => Only administrators can post.
            - 3 => Only [full members][calc-full-member] can post.
            - 4 => Only moderators can post.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0, replacing the previous
            `is_announcement_only` boolean.

            [permission-level]: /api/roles-and-permissions#permission-levels

        message_retention_days:

          nullable: true
          description: |
            Number of days that messages sent to this stream will be stored
            before being automatically deleted by the [message retention
            policy](/help/message-retention-policy). There are two special values:

            - `null`, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            - `-1` encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).
        history_public_to_subscribers:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public streams (i.e. invite_only=False implies
            history_public_to_subscribers=True), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.
        first_message_id:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The id of the first message in the stream.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "more topics" widget that would suggest the stream
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Null is used for streams with no message history.
        stream_weekly_traffic:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The average number of messages sent to the stream in recent weeks,
            rounded to the nearest integer.

            Null means the stream was recently created and there is
            insufficient data to estimate the average traffic.

              dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
              that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

            - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
              the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

            - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
              In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.

                reaction, including the user ID as the `id`
                field. Note that reactions data received from the

                  Will be null only for edit history
                  events predating March 2017.

                  Clients can display edit history events where this

            The other fields are optional, and will be present or not
            depending on whether the stream, topic, and/or message
            content were modified in the edit event. For example, if
            only the topic was edited, only `prev_topic` and `topic`
            will be present in addition to `user_id` and `timestamp`.

            though this could change if Zulip adds support for topics in private
            message conversations.

            The field name is a legacy holdover from when topics were
            called "subjects" and will eventually change.

            filters](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) that match content in the
            message's topic.)

            **Changes**: This field contained a list of urls before
            Zulip 4.0 (feature level 46).

            New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1): Previously, this field was called
            `subject_links`; clients are recommended to rename `subject_links` to `topic_links`

            query parameter was set to `True` and the user's avatar is hosted by
            the Gravatar provider (i.e. the user has never uploaded an avatar).

            **Changes**: In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18), if the client has the

      description: |
        A JSON-encoded array indicating which types of events you're interested
        in. Values that you might find useful include:

        - **message** (messages)
        - **subscription** (changes in your subscriptions)
        - **realm_user** (changes to users in the organization and
          their properties, such as their name).

        If you do not specify this parameter, you will receive all
        events, and have to filter out the events not relevant to
        your client in your client code. For most applications, one
        is only interested in messages, so one specifies:
        `event_types=['message']`

        Event types not supported by the server are ignored, in order to simplify
        the implementation of client apps that support multiple server versions.

        are using gravatar as their avatar. This option
        significantly reduces the compressed size of user data,
        since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not
        compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if

    ReactionType:
      name: reaction_type
      in: query
      description: |
        A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`
        has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

        If an API client is adding/removing a vote on an existing reaction,
        it should pass this parameter using the value the server provided
        for the existing reaction for specificity. Supported values:

        - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
          dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
          that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

        - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
          the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

        - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
          In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
          "zulip").

        **Changes**: In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 2), this become
        optional for [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji);
        previously, this endpoint assumed `unicode_emoji` if this
        parameter was not specified.

    EmojiCode:

      in: query
      description: |
        A unique identifier, defining the specific emoji codepoint requested,
        within the namespace of the `reaction_type`.

        For most API clients, you won't need this, but it's important
        for Zulip apps to handle rare corner cases when
        adding/removing votes on an emoji reaction added previously by
        another user.

        If the existing reaction was added when the Zulip server was
        using a previous version of the emoji data mapping between
        Unicode codepoints and human-readable names, sending the
        `emoji_code` in the data for the original reaction allows the
        Zulip server to correctly interpret your upvote as an upvote
        rather than a reaction with a "different" emoji.

        - "realm_default" => Return to the organization-level setting.
        - "unlimited" => Retain messages forever.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 91), retaining
        messages forever was encoded using `"forever"` instead of
        `"unlimited"`.

        New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).
