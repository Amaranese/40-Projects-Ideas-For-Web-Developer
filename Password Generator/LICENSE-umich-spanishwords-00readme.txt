Welcome to the University of Michigan Linguistics Archive.
 
These archives are at archive.umich.edu in the /linguistics directory.
Please use the symbolic internet address if you can, since the archives
move occasionally.
 
--- what's here ---
There is a collection of public domain, freeware, shareware, and other
files that may be useful to linguists.  Here are the directories you
will see in archive/linguistics:
 
    /fonts            various fonts of interest to linguists
    /texts            a number of types of non-software directories:
      /texts/biblio,
      /texts/lexica   (containing word lists),
      /texts/papers   (containing offprints, and
       /texts/papers/available, containing publication lists),
      /texts/syllabi  (containing the COSWL syllabus collection), and
      /texts/indices  (containing the Levin verb index)
    /linguist.list    back issues of LINGUIST mailing list
    /software         programs of interest to linguists
    /celtline         maintained as an online service for the
                         Association for Celtic Linguistics
    /uploads          recently submitted files, including software;
                         this directory may be written to but not read;
